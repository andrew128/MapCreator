ShortestPathFinder
===================
Users will be able to find the shortest path between two points in a grid. 
The user specifies the dimensions of the grid, the start and end locations, and obstacles. 
The program then calculates and displays the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm (also specifying if there is no shortest path).

Project done with @fonsecaeli and Lucas
